**PART A**

**1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions**

Internet websites have two main parts: the front-end and the back-end. These parts work together to make a website functional and interactive for users. Here's how they work:

Front-end: The front-end is what users see and interact with on a website. It includes the design, layout, and user interface elements. It uses technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The front-end development process involves: a. HTML: It creates the structure and content of web pages, like headings, paragraphs, images, and forms. b. CSS: It controls how the web pages look, including colors, fonts, and layout. c. JavaScript: It adds interactive features like animations and form validation.

Front-end developers focus on making the website easy to use and visually appealing for users on different devices and browsers.

Back-end: The back-end handles the behind-the-scenes functionality of a website. It involves programming, managing databases, and handling requests between the server and the user.

The main parts of back-end development are: a. Programming languages: They handle the logic and processing on the server, generating dynamic content and interacting with databases. b. Databases: They store and manage the website's data. c. Web servers: They process user requests and send back responses. d. APIs: They enable communication between different software systems.

Back-end developers focus on creating secure server applications, managing data, and ensuring the website works well.

In summary, front-end development focuses on creating the visible and interactive parts of a website, while back-end development handles the behind-the-scenes processes and data management. Both parts work together to create a complete and functional website.

**2. What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example**

HTML tags are used to structure and define the content of a web page. Here are some categories of HTML tags with examples:

Headings (h1-h6): Headings are used to define the titles and headings of sections on a web page. There are six levels of headings, from h1 (the highest) to h6 (the lowest). The h1 tag is typically used for the main heading, while the h2-h6 tags are used for subheadings of decreasing importance.

This is a Heading
Paragraphs (p): The p tag is used to define paragraphs of text. It creates a block of text with proper spacing and indentation.

This is a paragraph.

Links (a): The a tag creates hyperlinks that allow users to navigate between web pages or specific parts of a page. The href attribute specifies the destination URL Click here

Images (img): The img tag is used to insert images into a web page. The src attribute specifies the image source (file path or URL), and the alt attribute provides alternative text for screen readers or if the image fails to load. Description of the image

Lists (ul, ol, li): HTML offers different types of lists. The ul (unordered list) tag creates a bulleted list, while the ol (ordered list) tag creates a numbered list. Each list item is defined using the li tag.

Item 1
Item 2
These tags help define the structure, headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists on a web page. They play a crucial role in creating the content and layout of a website.

**3. Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.

The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept used in frameworks like React to efficiently update and render user interfaces. Here's an explanation of its working procedure:

Initial Render: When a React component is first rendered, it creates a lightweight copy of the actual DOM called the Virtual DOM.

Virtual DOM Representation: The Virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation of the HTML structure, organized as a tree of objects that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM.

Component Updates: When a React component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM representing the updated UI.

Diffing Algorithm: React compares the previous Virtual DOM with the new one using a diffing algorithm. It efficiently identifies the specific changes made to the Virtual DOM.

Minimal DOM Updates: By determining the differences between the previous and new Virtual DOM, React calculates the minimum number of changes required to update the actual DOM.

Efficient DOM Manipulation: React applies the calculated changes to the actual DOM, updating only the necessary elements and attributes. This results in optimized and faster UI updates.

The Virtual DOM enables React to efficiently update and render UI components by reducing the number of direct manipulations on the actual DOM. By comparing and calculating the minimal updates needed, React ensures a more efficient rendering process.

**4.**Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL in precise

Differences between MySQL and NoSQL:

Data Model:

MySQL: Uses structured tables, rows, and columns. NoSQL: Offers flexibility with various data models like key-value, document, columnar, and graph. Scalability:

MySQL: Scales vertically by increasing server capacity. NoSQL: Scales horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers. Query Language:

MySQL: Uses SQL (Structured Query Language). NoSQL: Has different query languages or APIs depending on the database. Schema:

MySQL: Enforces a fixed schema, requiring predefined structure. NoSQL: Provides schema flexibility, allowing dynamic modifications without strict rules. ACID Compliance:

MySQL: ACID-compliant for strong data integrity. NoSQL: Varies in ACID compliance levels, prioritizing scalability and performance. Use Cases:

MySQL: Suitable for complex transactions, structured data, e-commerce, finance, etc. NoSQL: Used in scenarios with large-scale data, flexible structures, real-time analytics, IoT, etc. These simplified points highlight the main differences between MySQL and NoSQL databases, considering factors like data models, scalability, querying, schema flexibility, ACID compliance, and common use cases.

**5.**Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words

PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source DBMS that excels in storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. It follows a relational data model, organizing data into tables with rows and columns. With SQL (Structured Query Language) support, PostgreSQL enables seamless interaction with the database. It ensures data integrity through constraints and offers transaction management for reliable operations. PostgreSQL's extensibility allows customization with custom data types, functions, and operators. It handles concurrency through Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) and provides advanced features like JSON support and geospatial processing. PostgreSQL's reliability, flexibility, and rich feature set make it a popular choice for various applications.
